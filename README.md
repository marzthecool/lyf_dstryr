## Project Description ##
The ðŸ’¥ Life Destroyer 5000 ðŸ’¥ is an Elixir program that emulates a ramsomware attack.
This program, it will find and start encrypting all files within the directory where it is located. 
It will also create a hidden key that will be exchanged for a bitcoin deposit >:D
By entering the hidden key, the program will de-encrypt the previously affected files.

## Language: ## 
Elixir

## Proposed solution: ##
It will be done using an implementation of SHA-256 hash in Elixir.

We will be using the following elixir modules:
* IO
* File
* Path

The following topics will be applied to our solution:
* Functional programming

     Our program will be written in Elixir, which is a functional program that will allows us to build our application using functions.
* Recursion

     We will be using recursion during the implementation of the SHA-256 algorithm.
* Lists

     We will be using lists to easily manage and process the data we will be working with.
* File I/O

     As we will be working with files that will become encrypted.
