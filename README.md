## Project Description ##
The ðŸ’¥ Life Destroyer 5000 ðŸ’¥ is an Elixir program that emulates a ramsomware attack.

This program will find and encrypt a given file **located within the provided directory**. 

The encryption will be done usign de Galois/Counter Mode algorithm. 
The Galois/Counter Mode algorithm is a is a mode of operation for symmetric-key cryptographic block ciphers which is widely adopted for its performance. The operation is an authenticated encryption algorithm designed to provide both data authenticity (integrity) and confidentiality. GCM is defined for block ciphers with a block size of 128 bits.

By entering the hidden key, the program will recuperate an original copy of the previously affected files.

The key will be generated by creating a binary composed of 16 random bytes using ErlagÂ´s :crypto.strong_rand_bytes/1. This binary is encoded to a 64-base using ErlagÂ´s :base64.encode/1 obtaining a string that can be stored in a file. This key also help botth encode and decode files. 

## Language: ## 
Elixir

## Proposed solution: ##

We will be using the following elixir modules:
* IO
* File
* Path

The following topics will be applied to our solution:
* Functional programming

     Our program will be written in Elixir, which is a functional program that will allows us to build our application using functions.
* Recursion

     We will be using recursion during the implementation of the SHA-256 algorithm.
* Lists

     We will be using lists to easily manage and process the data we will be working with.
* File I/O

     As we will be working with files that will become encrypted.
